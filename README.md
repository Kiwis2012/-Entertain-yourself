# Class InfoProc
Another again in 2020 May... implements of three ways to classificate the audios provided by teacher, including dense net, cnn, svm. (Keras). 
The accuracy of raw data and augmented data is:
    | RAW | Dense Net  | CNN Net  |
|  ----  | ----  |  ----  |
| SGD  | 68.85% | 80.33% |
| Adam | 75.41% | 81.97%|


| AUG | Dense Net  | CNN Net  |
|  ----  | ----  |  ----  |
| SGD  | 81.97% | 86.89% |

# Class AdvancedProgramDesign
Another course in 2020 Jan... a system of library management, the teacher said it`s too simple for a complete system.

`lib_manage.py`

# Class PatternRecognition

`whale.py`

humpback and whale identification from https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification/overview
the public score until 13DEC is 0.279, really bad.

`w13svm.py`

generate some points and classificate them by linear and nonlinear SVM

`AdvancedDigitalImageProcessing.py`

Homework for class, including Dichotomous methods, Fibonacci methods, Newton and Gradient Descent 
methods to find the minimum value of the function, also really bad but still works
